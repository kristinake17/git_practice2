This is an awesome file I added directly from GitHub.com
And now I am about to commit directly to GitHub.com remote repository
This is not something we would do normally
We are just trying to simulate a situation where remote repository history is ahead of local repsitory history
In plain Englist remote has one additional commit that local does not have
